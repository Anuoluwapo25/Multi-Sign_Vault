## 🌟 What is SecureVault Bitcoin Treasury?

SecureVault is the first open-source enterprise treasury management solution built on **Stacks blockchain** for Nigerian businesses operating with Bitcoin and digital assets. Leveraging Bitcoin's security with Stacks' smart contract capabilities, it provides enterprise-grade multi-signature treasury management while maintaining full transparency and regulatory compliance.

## 🎯 Why Stacks + Bitcoin for Nigerian Enterprises?

Traditional enterprise treasury management lacks:

❌ **Native Bitcoin integration** with smart contract capabilities  
❌ **Transparent, auditable** smart contract infrastructure on Bitcoin  
❌ **Bulk payment capabilities** for payroll and vendor management  
❌ **Multi-signature security** suitable for corporate governance  
❌ **Integration** with Nigerian business workflows and compliance  

**Multi-Sign_Vault
 solves all of these challenges using Bitcoin's security layer.**
